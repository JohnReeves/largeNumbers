Illustrating the rollover at 21-digits.

## the 4 topics in computer science

### internal representation of numbers

why is there a 20 digit limit?

### representing numbers as strings

how can you represent long numbers as string?

writing a full class is *hard*, maybe 1000 lines.

gmp is this sort of thing - so functions not operators.

### approximations of pi

how *can* you calculate pi?
lot's of seriers solutions
what about a randomised algorithm?

### dynamic memory

how can you grow your datatype?
